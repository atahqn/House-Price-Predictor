Kings County House Price Prediction
This project aims to build a model that can predict the house prices in Kings County. The data used for this project is the Kings County House Price dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.

The process of the project is broken down into four key steps: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building. Each step is represented by a Python script.

1. Data Preprocessing (data_preprocessing.py)
Data preprocessing is an important step in any machine learning project. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing the features.

In this script, we first load the dataset using pandas, then perform various preprocessing tasks. For example, we might handle missing data by filling in with the mean of the column, or removing the rows entirely. We might also do some feature scaling, such as normalization or standardization, to ensure that our machine learning algorithm can process the data efficiently.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (exploratory_data_analysis.py)
In the EDA process, we get to understand the data by visualizing the distribution of various features and their relationship with the target variable.

This script uses libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to plot different features against each other to understand the correlations between them. It also plots distributions of the target variable to check if it follows a normal distribution. Any anomalies observed in this stage will be corrected in the preprocessing stage.

3. Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py)
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or modifying existing features which might result in improving the model's performance.

In this script, we might generate new features from existing ones, such as creating a feature that represents the age of the house, or the total number of rooms per floor. This often involves domain knowledge about the problem at hand.

4. Modeling (model.py)
This is the script where we define, train and evaluate our machine learning model. We use the Scikit-learn library to import the machine learning algorithm (such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or more complex ones like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting).

First, we split the data into a training set and a testing set. Then, we fit the model on the training data and make predictions on the test data. Finally, we evaluate the model by calculating the error between the predicted and actual prices on the test set.
